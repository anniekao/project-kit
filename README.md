# Introduction
Project KIT (Keep In Touch) was built to help users navigate the networking world. Users are able to scan each other's QR-codes, saving the new contact's information (email, social media links) and the event where they met each other. A personal event calendar also gives users the ability to look for upcoming events, to save/delete them and keep track of where their next networking opportunity is happening.
